# Agentic AI

## Introduction

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to act autonomously toward achieving goals. Unlike passive AI systems that respond to inputs, agentic AI systems can plan, reason, take actions, and adapt over time with minimal human intervention.

Agentic AI is a key step toward more general and autonomous intelligent systems.

## What Is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is an entity that:
- Observes its environment
- Makes decisions
- Takes actions
- Learns from outcomes

Agents operate in environments that may be deterministic or stochastic, static or dynamic.
